Yesterday I showed you how you can more easily [[chose the color and line-width|Adding A ColorPicker For Editing Images]] for TiddlyWiki's ability to [[draw on images|http://tiddlywiki.com/#EditBitmapWidget]].

As [[PMario points out|https://groups.google.com/d/msg/tiddlywiki/qkGGkAli1zw/oTyuvVglem0J]], to create a blank canvas to draw on, simply create a new tiddler and set it's type to one of the editable image types, e.g. `image/png`,  `image/jpg`,  `image/gif`.

To round things up, here's some button code [[suggested by Birthe|https://groups.google.com/d/msg/tiddlywiki/qkGGkAli1zw/2nQmzn5eENkJ]] that allows you to create a blank canvas to paint on to your heart's content:

<$macrocall $name=`
text="""<$button tooltip="Create new sketch">
<$action-sendmessage
$message="tm-new-tiddler"
title=""
text=""
tags="Image"
type= "image/jpg"
/>New sketch</$button>"""/>

''Note:'' I could not find out how to initialize the canvas with a different width and height yet.
